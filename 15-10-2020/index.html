					<p>Luna Maes was born in Veurne, Belgium in 1944. She is the founder and the inspiration behind all we do. Her vision was to bring a slice of her home town to Australia, after moving to Melbourne Victoria in 1972. She still visits the kitchen from time to time and chats with our guests.</p>
					<p>The Luna Maes Jam product range launched in 1989 with a classic marmalade, followed by a mulberry confit. The full range is available in store at both our locations.</p>
